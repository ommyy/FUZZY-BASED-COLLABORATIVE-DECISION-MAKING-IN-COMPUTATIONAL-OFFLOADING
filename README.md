# FUZZY-BASED-COLLABORATIVE-DECISION-MAKING-IN-COMPUTATIONAL-OFFLOADING
Now a days there are high-demanding applications and services, such as mobile augmented reality, gesture and face recognition, intelligent transportation, smart healthcare, interactive gaming, human heart-rate monitoring, voice recognition, natural language processing, and wearable virtual reality streaming are undergoing tremendous developments.

In addition to these the data traffic rises  exponentially. Therefore,  execution of tasks takes lot of process and also consumes alot of power.For these solutions are mcc,cloudlet,fog computing ,etc. MEC has emerged as a promising approach to cope with growing computing demands.

These systems also have pros and cons while dealing with these type of situation.novel collaborative task offloading scheme among multiple SBS–MEC servers to boost the computation offloading service. By this e the load of local SBS-MEC servers and the execution time as the tasks are distributed among neighboring SBS-MEC servers.


In this fuzzy logic is used. , fuzzy logic is the most employed method because its computation complexity is lower with respect to different decision-making algorithms.it is to deal with the collaborative task offloading problem in MEC-enabled scenario.

An simulator is also  used to simulate results and it is compared with other policies also.
