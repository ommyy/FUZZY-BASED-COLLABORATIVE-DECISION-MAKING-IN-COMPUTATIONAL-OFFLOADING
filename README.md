# FUZZY-BASED-COLLABORATIVE-DECISION-MAKING-IN-COMPUTATIONAL-OFFLOADING
Now a days there are high-demanding applications and services, such as mobile augmented reality, gesture and face recognition, intelligent transportation, smart healthcare, interactive gaming, human heart-rate monitoring, voice recognition, natural language processing, and wearable virtual reality streaming are undergoing tremendous developments.
With these the data traffic rises  exponentially. Therefore, storing, processing big data, and supporting real-time as well as computation-intensive tasks and processing capability and battery-life time, the execution of latency-sensitive and computation-intensive applications in user devices will undoubtedly affect the QoS and performance.
